    "    * Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers\n",
    "    * Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about\n",

    "* Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).\n",
    "    * the following input is ok:  “1\\n2,3”  (will equal 6)\n",
    "    * the following input is NOT ok:  “1,\\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)\n",
    "* Support different delimiters\n",
    "    * to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this:   “//[delimiter]\\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .\n",
    "    * the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported\n",

    "* Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:  “//[delimiter]\\n” for example: “//[***]\\n1***2***3” should return 6\n",
    "* Allow multiple delimiters like this:  “//[delim1][delim2]\\n” for example “//[*][%]\\n1*2%3” should return 6.\n",
    "* make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one char"
